# Reddit to Instagram posting webapp
Web app I wrote that allows users to use Reddit's praw to automate posts on Instagram (using IG's API).
Flask is underlying infrastructure.

### Things I wanted to get out of this project:
Main purpose of this project is to help me automate/streamline posting process on my business IG page. So when I wrote the code, I didn't mind it to be spaghetti and non-pythonic. In retrospect, that's bad practice.
I also wanted to learn and pick up how use APIs, Flask, basic html, SQL, and generally work with a larger project.

I think I'm done with this project. The tool is very useful to me, and I use it daily to manage my IG page. I may add a feature that allows scaling to multiple IG pages.

PS: If you'd like to implement as similar script, feel free to fork!
